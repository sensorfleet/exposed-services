    Redis is designed to be accessed by trusted clients inside trusted
    environments. This means that usually it is not a good idea to expose the

    Unsecured Mongo databases accessible online are a common root cause for data
    breaches. In fact, the average time for an exposed Mongo database to get
    breached is 13 hours. Check whether your service really needs to be online,
    and if so, that it implements at least the following security measures:
