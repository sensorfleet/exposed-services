mongodb:
  name: MongoDB
  ports:
    - "27017-27019"

    Unsecured Mongo databases accessible online are a common root cause for data breaches.
    In fact, the average time for an exposed Mongo database to get breached is 13 hours.
    Check whether your service really needs to be online, and if so, that it implements at least
    the following security measures: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist/
