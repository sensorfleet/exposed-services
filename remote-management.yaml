    "By default, RFB is not a secure protocol. While passwords are not
    sent in plain-text (as in telnet), cracking could prove successful
    if both the encryption key and encoded password were sniffed from
    a network. For this reason it is recommended that a password of at
    least 8 characters be used." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing#Security
